Welcome to the official GitHub page of the **Cactus Team**! We are a passionate group of hobby developers who build stuff on the internet. We're mainly working on the multi-purpose client-side mod [**Cactus Mod**](https://cactusmod.xyz).

> [!NOTE]  
> Currently, we only actively support the latest version we published. Versions before that don't get updated and may contain issues which we've already resolved. We currently just don't have the resources to maintain support for multiple versions at once.
